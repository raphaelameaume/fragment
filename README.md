![UI is splitted in two columns, the left one has a centered canvas displaying squares arranged in a grid, the right column contains various controls for colos, variables and exports](https://github.com/raphaelameaume/fragment/blob/add-screencapture-to-readme/screenshot.png "Screencapture of Fragment")

`fragment` aims to provide a simple API to work with `<canvas>`. It comes with built-in GUIs and a set of *triggers* to make your sketches **interactive**.

## Features

- Multiple rendering modes: [Canvas 2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/), [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [WebGL fragment shaders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLShader)
- Built-in GUI from sketch files
- Export `<canvas>` to images (.png, .webm, .jpg) or videos (.mp4, .webm, .gif) on the fly
- Hot shader reloading & [glslify](https://github.com/glslify/glslify) support

## Installation

`fragment` is not yet available on [npmjs.com](npmjs.com) so you need to clone and link the project in order to use it. It's only a few steps.

```
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/raphaelameaume/fragment

# move to the project directory
cd fragment

# link the project
npm link
``` 

You should now be able to run `fragment` from your command line. If you encounter any issues, you can read more about linking on [npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link).

## Usage

```
# create a new directory for your sketches
mkdir ../sketches

# move into that folder
cd sketches

# initialize npm for linking to work
npm init

# create a sketch from a template
fragment ./sketch.js --new --template=2d
```

Learn more about the available flag options in the [CLI docs](./docs/api/CLI.md).

## Example

This is an example of a sketch drawing a blue circle on a black background with a custom control for the radius of the circle.

```js
export let props = {
  radius: {
    value: 10,
    params: {
      min: 4,
      max: 30
    }
  }
};

export let update = ({ context, width, height }) => {
  // draw background
  context.fillStyle = '#000000';
  context.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

  // draw circle
  const radius = props.radius.value;

  context.fillStyle = '#0000ff';
  context.beginPath();
  context.arc(width * 0.5, height * 0.5, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
  context.fill();
};
```
